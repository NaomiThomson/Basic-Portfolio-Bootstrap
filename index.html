        <img src="assets/images/yoga.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Naomi Thomson">

        <p>I'm in my fifth year of college, studying Materials Science Engineering, but hoping to do web development as a career. I like reading comic books, playing video games, and doing yoga in my free time. I grew up in Taiwan and moved here when I was 7 years old, so English is technically my second language.</p>

        <p>When I was younger, I wanted to be an environmental activist and go sit in forest trees to stop people from bulldozing them over. Although I don't have the same zealousness or tenacity to do that anymore, I still am very much a nature lover! I also deeply care about human rights issues, such as LGBTQ rights and human trafficking.</p>

        <p>Ideally I want to work for a company that shares my same concerns and works to make the world a better place!</p>
